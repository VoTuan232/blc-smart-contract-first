# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

accounts	Prints the list of accounts
check   	Check whatever you need
clean   	Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
compile 	Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
console 	Opens a hardhat console
flatten 	Flattens and prints contracts and their dependencies
help    	Prints this message
node    	Starts a JSON-RPC server on top of Hardhat Network
run     	Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project
test    	Runs mocha tests
