Welcome to the DApp Course where we will be building an NFT Marketplace from scratch! 

I'm eager to get started with you but I just wanted to give you a quick heads up, before we dive in. 
This first section is purely optional, if you'd like to get a very basic review on the fundamentals 
of DApps and decentralization for its use case and problem solving statement.

In this upcoming section we do not refer to any programming or technical attributions 
(nor do we go into any project specifics - besides the OpenSea marketplace case study and analogies). 
That means that if you're just itching to get started feel free to jump into the second section 
where we dive into building our project local environment right off the bat. It's entirely up to you.

You can always use this as reference to come back to and expect the content to be refreshed and updated over time or
 if you'd like to cover the basics with me then please do continue onto the next video. :)

Alright, that's it for now and catch you in the next video!
