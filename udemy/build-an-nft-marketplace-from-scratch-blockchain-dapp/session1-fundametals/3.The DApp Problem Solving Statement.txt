So when we talk about it, d'application, you may hear on the media, Charles Hoskinson or people talking

and they say or whoever saying, Yeah, that's, you know, they cut out the middleman, they cut out

the middleman.

So what does that really mean?

Right?

What is this middleman?

Well, let's consider a very prominent applications such as Uber.

Now, hopefully you've heard of Uber unless you've been living under some kind of rock isolated on a

completely self-sufficient island, which is essentially a delivery service application.

It's an application which provides deliverable services like a taxi service.

It can deliver people from one location to another with its drivers as well as food.

So Uber is an application, but essentially it acts as a middleman.

Right?

And how so?

How do I mean?

Well, just in the sense that you have a delivery person and these drivers are doing the actual service

are providing the actual service?

Right.

Uber essentially acts as a middleman, which connects the drivers to the customers.

All right.

So the power, the power or even the promise, we can say the promise reason why the applications and

in part in part of the reason as to why these applications have been getting so much spotlight is the

promise that imagine imagine that when you pay for something such as a food delivery service like Uber,

you no longer have to pay the company and all those extra fees, and instead you can pay the delivery

person directly.

You can pay them directly with an app or a tap.

The applications aim in this sense to cut out the middleman.

Now, DEXs are an excellent example of that.

For those of you familiar with trading on Uniswap versus trading on, let's say, Coinbase.

But the potential here, and hopefully this analogy illustrates that is outstanding in comparison to

much more than just trading crypto.

OK.
