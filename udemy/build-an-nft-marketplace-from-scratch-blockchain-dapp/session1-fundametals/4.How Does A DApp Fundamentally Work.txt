All right.

So let's dive into how do the apps actually work?

Gap, which the D stands for, hopefully, hopefully you've guessed decentralized.

All right.

So so these decentralized applications, they work just like normal applications, except for one.

One major difference.

All right.

And technically speaking, we can say that DApps work via a peer to peer or P2P network, such as a

blockchain.

All right.

Such as a blockchain.

And hopefully you and hopefully if you're taking this course, you already are familiar with blockchains

with what our blockchains and that they act as this digital ledger of transactions that get duplicated

across an entire network.

And this provides a secure way for individuals to directly deal with each other, right directly deal

with each other without a central point of authority, be it a bank, government or application or executive

application such as Uber.

OK, so DApps work via a P2P network such as a blockchain.

And the key takeaway, then, is that no one single authority, so no one single authority can control

the network, right?

No one single authority can control the network.

You would need to have a majority of control in order to make changes.

Otherwise, the duplications are processed across the network.

So in terms of defining a d'application, let's take a look at three key features.

In order to get a.

Fundamental sense and definition towards applications.

So one, we can say that the data and the records must be public.

All right.

So when we consider Etherium right, when we consider the Etherium blockchain, we know that all the

transactions, every single transaction is recorded on a public ledger, which can then be downloaded

and accessed, and that information is set up for public record.

Another key future Another key feature is the security of the network with cryptographic tokens and

without getting too deep into cryptographic tokens.

Now we can say that they are a digital unit of value that lives on the blockchain and that can include,

of course, payment tokens, utility tokens, security tokens and the token which we will be looking

at in this course, particularly nonfungible tokens, a.k.a. NFT, is all right.

And the third key feature here is that a d'application must have open source fundamentals.

All right, open source fundamentals.

All right.

And I just want to point out that these are the general beliefs of the blockchain communities.

And although many DApps may have some form of combination, if not all of these features.

So these are three key features to consider course.

We must take a look individually at each example, respectively.

All right.
