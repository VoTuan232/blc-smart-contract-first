So let's discuss now what are the benefits of d'application, so why why are we building the applications?

Why are we excited about them?

Why can't we stop talking about them and bothering our friends, our family, our friends, our families,

our colleagues with all this talk of DApps?

Well, let's consider that they have protection against censorship, and censorship is a is becoming

more and more of a bigger issue in technology today.

And as we.

That's what applications can provide for a solution against censorship is that decentralization enables,

in effect, a shield against any single point of failure.

And so because of this, no one authority can manipulate or gain control of data and information and

censor information.

Another reason for building a d'application is to consider downtime resistance.

All right.

So what do I mean by downtime resistance?

The network will continue to run via peer to peer, even if several individual units or a large chunk

goes down now.

Now I can just remember two days ago from delivering this lecture that Facebook went down.

Facebook was down for a large portion on the eastern coast, and it went down because it is centralized.

And when its database is in trouble, when there are issues, then the entire user ecosystem suffers.

All right.

So downtime resistance, being able to continue to run even if you have issues happening on several

on several computer systems is an excellent benefit.

And another benefit I'd like for you to consider is decentralized finance.

All right.

The future of DeFi and the imperative I would I would even go as far as to say and the fact that DeFi

is an integrated both solution much more easily when it comes to applications than it would with applications.

Because when we are running on its application, it allows for our platform to have easy wiring compatibility

with cryptocurrency for basic functionalities.

All right.

This is something that we are going to with our our marketplace.

And finally, let's take a look at the fact that the applications are linked into open source fundamentals.

So does that means so that means that developers, since two applications have open source visibility,

then developers in general can build better systems.

Because of that, they can make improvements requests.

And this widespread improvement through the open source visibility lends itself much more to overall

better qualitative evolution.
