### Quick note 
- Open source hack
- Ugly UI & Poor UX
- Web2 and The networking effect 

###

All right, so we've taken a look at some of the d'application benefits, but I would not be doing a

great job as an instructor if we did not also then therefore cover vulnerabilities and application weaknesses.

So what are some of the weaknesses when considering the applications?

So because we are looking at open source, then hacking becomes an issue, then we need to consider

how hackers and bad actors can take advantage of this.

So public visibility provides bad actors more leverage, therefore, to look for and exploit weaknesses.

Right.

And we've seen this.

This has happened.

This has happened on many, many platforms, from DEXs to NFT marketplaces.

All right.

Also, we have to consider that the UI and the UX right now when it comes to DApps is not in its optimal

place compared to what we see with web to applications, right?

Many DApps, I would even say most DApps currently have not the best UI, which puts off its users.

But this is something which is improving with time and this is why we are here, right?

We are here to help improve this.

I would imagine some of you may be in fact leaders into making these improvements.

All right.

We just rushed on web, too.

So let us also then consider the network effect.

OK.

So the current users compared to Web two, are low, rendering them less interactive and lower network

effect often can be tied as well to the DApps overall security.

All right.

The less user interaction, the less user database information, the easier it may be computationally

for bad actors to take advantage.

All right.

So again, this does point to early stages.

In my opinion.

This points to early stages and it is a question of the development process and scalability issues in

order to overcome these issues.
