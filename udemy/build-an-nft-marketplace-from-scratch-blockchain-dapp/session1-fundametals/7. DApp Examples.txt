So we've gone over some application examples, but let's get a little bit more specific now and take

a look at some d'application examples.

So feel free to follow along on your computer.

I'm going to use the browser now or just continue to watch.

It's totally up to you.

Again, we are not programming, so I want us to go to W WW W Dot State of the Daps dot com.

So when you get to state of the DApps dot com, what you see essentially an explorer, an explorer for

decentralized applications.

So state of the DApps covers the applications and statistics on the applications on Ethereum, EOS,

Hive, Neo, blockchain, etc. with the definitive registry of that projects and information that's

going on.

So we see we have different blockchains that we can switch to when we get to the homepage and they even

provide a ranking system.

So if we were to click, if we were to click on the Ethereum, we get to a page here now where we see

Ethereum rankings.

So these are d'application rankings and the number one we see the number one DApp is open.

See?

All right.

Right now.

This, of course, is just according to a ranking system brought to us by state of the DApps.

And if we want to go into their metrics and how it comes together, you can feel free to check that

out on your own.

I'm not going to go into that, but I did feel it relevant to point you in the direction of other d'application

so that you have a point of reference.

If you're curious about the application development there is, there is much more, of course, than

just NFT marketplaces, albeit that being a very trending topic.

So OpenSea is a peer to peer marketplace for scarce digital goods, which are going to take a look at

in a little bit.

So we're not going to go into it, but essentially we are building the basic functionality of OpenSea

for ourselves.

All right.

So we see Tether the digital money for a digital age.

All right.

So we have a stablecoin.

We see Chainlink, which offers API real world data, which we refer to as oracles for events and payments

and smart contracts.

We have, of course, the DEX Uniswap, which is a protocol for automated token exchange.

We have a virtual world, Decentraland, which runs on open standards and the list goes on.

So feel free to check this out.

It's very inspiring.

It's very inspiring and interesting, and they even have DApps per category.

So you can see we have gaming applications, gambling finance socials, huge wallet, governance, security,

storage, even energy, health and insurance.
