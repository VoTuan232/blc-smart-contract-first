- NFT project 
- về cơ bản OpenSea hoạt động như một eBay phi tập trung.
- For NFT is non-fungible tokens.
- Seller - Buyer 
    - Match Buyer with seller exchange
    - contract receives assets
    - contract distributes assets 
    - Register 
    - Tất cả hoạt động trong mạng lưới Ethereum hoặc Polygon là blockchain 
    - quyền sở hữu là không thể tranh cãi.

And so specifically, since we are building in this course, an NFT marketplace, let's take a deep

dive plan superintended on OpenSea and break down essentially what the functionality is here.

What we want to accomplish.

What are our goals and how does OpenSea do this?

Because I'm a firm believer in looking at successful examples when it comes to building, building and

manifesting our own successes.

So in order to understand the mechanisms behind OpenSea, it's important to understand how smart contracts

work.

And this in effect, is how OpenSea works.

So OpenSea essentially is acts as a decentralized eBay.

All right.

For NFT is non-fungible tokens.

Therefore, you have buyers, so you have users who wish to buy NFTs by these unique individual, irreplaceable

and interchangeable tokens.

You have users who want to sell collectibles, so these can be users who have minted tokens, or these

can be users who have bought tokens and wish to sell those tokens.

So already we can be thinking, OK, we're going to need pages.

We're going to need a page which offers the marketplace where all the NFTs are up for sale.

And this is where our buyers can go.

And we're going to need to have a page in order to mint and make these NFTs to put them up for sale.

And then we're going to need to match.

We're going to need to build out the functionality that allows this to happen.

So that means matching a buyer with seller exchanges and doing that contracts, receiving assets, contracts,

distributing assets, then clearing and settlement automation.

And of course, this goes up onto the Ethereum or Polygon in this case, blockchain, in which case

the ownership is undisputed.

So we call these our digital digital collectibles.

All right.

So this is in effect how OpenSea works on the most fundamental level.

Now, of course, you can get much more specific when it comes to metadata and reflecting information,

filtering for searching and all sorts of excellent features you can continue to integrate.

Now, before we start coding, we will take a look at our final project as well, and that should help

you to get a better sense of why we are building each component and how it's going to work together.

But I still think this preliminary analysis is also quite beneficial.
