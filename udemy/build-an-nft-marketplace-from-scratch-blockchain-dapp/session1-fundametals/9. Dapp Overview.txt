There are already thousands of applications offering a wide variety of services, and yet we are still

very, very early.

You know, I often get that question clarion, is it too late?

Is it too late?

No, it is not too late.

This is equivalent to being in the early 90s, asking if it's too late for the internet.

There is so much to be built and so much to advance, and coming in now is as good a time as ever.

So before DApps explode into the zeitgeist.

You know, before we start seeing applications, our favorite Netflix shows on our favorite podcasts,

on everybody's phones without thinking twice.

We still have a ways, way to go.

That being said, developers and the networks that they build DApps on still face many, many obstacles

to overcome, and we've addressed this in this course.

Scalability.

Right?

Security.

UI and UX.

Are among those obstacles which which we face, which we must face head on in the Coliseum of programming

deep in the lion's den.

But once that happens, the rise of decentralized applications will manifest.

OK, so this is why we are here.

We are here to learn how we can be better d'application developers.

We are here to build, gain knowledge and I am very excited to go through to go through the upcoming

lessons with you.

So enough with the happening.

Let's get to the happening and start building out our very own d'application together.

I'll see you in the next lesson.

And may the DeFi be with you.
