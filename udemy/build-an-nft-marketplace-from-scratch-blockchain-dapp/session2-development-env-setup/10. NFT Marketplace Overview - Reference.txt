All right, so before we dive in and build this project out together, let's actually take a look at

the final project model that we're building so that we have a clearer perspective and understanding

of what our tasks are, what our goals are and all that good stuff.

All right.

So this is the marketplace in all of its glory.

All right.

So we have a nice title up here.

We have a nav with different pages that we can switch to.

So with a little bit of a nice CSS animation when we hover over the mouse and a thematic background

image to support the overall UI experience and of course, our most prized possession and NFT, right?

We see this is an NFT, which I just meant it.

So this is a crypto bird.

It's part of this crypto bird marketplace.

It's the first one.

Now I've uniquely input it a name and a description, so these can be changed as metadata.

This is an IPFS hosted file image as well.

And we also set the custom price.

Now let's start off of a quick one.

Can I buy this NFT?

Well, let's test it out.

So if I click buy.

There we go.

We see a transaction from the account.

Moving forward, I can confirm with MetaMask and the transaction gets confirmed after I buy this NFT.

The NFT is removed from the marketplace, but if I click on my NFT, as we see now that the NFT is added

to the my NFT page.

All right, awesome.

So this is a fully functioning marketplace.

Let's take a look at what else.

We have a Mint Tokens page, and in the Mint Tokens page, we see a form.

Now this form.

Now this form asks us for an input name, a description, the price in Ether, and then a picture to

upload to IPFS, which we can then only which we can mint only if we have all of these features together.

So let's go ahead and add something.

So I'm going to add another crypto bird song to say K Bird zero zero two.

And I'll say this is the second crypto bird added to the it's just one crypto bird added to our awesome

marketplace.

We'll add a price here.

I'll say 50 it.

Let's browse for a token, so I will grab an image file here.

Let's grab the wizard.

All right.

And let's mint.

So I'll click on meant we see we get prompted by MetaMask to run a transaction of some gas fees.

We can confirm the transaction and boom.

The transaction has been confirmed.

Then on the second transaction, we see the price of the market, so we got to confirm that amount.

And by confirming that second amount, we then send our NFT and mint it onto the blockchain with a zero

address.

So once we met our token, we send it to a zero address and then it exists in the marketplace until

some until somebody buys it.

Now, can we keep track of these NFTs in the meantime?

Well, if we go to our account dashboard, we see that we have our tokens minted.

So even though these tokens exist in a zero address and we're going to see how all of this works once

we start coding together, we see that our users who still create the minted tokens should still have

access to them on the dashboard, and that makes sense with the prices.

So we have the account dashboard, which is iterating through tokens that are users, meant we have

my NFT, which is the token, which are the tokens which we buy.

The NFT is that we purchase.

We have the minting tokens, which is a form in order to mint tokens to the marketplace.

And then we have the main marketplace, which showcases all of our users tokens.

So this is a pretty rounded, awesome project.

We're actually reverse engineering from a talented developer who wrote up an article on how to build

this, and I'll provide a link.

And and then the final thing to show you would be on.

Final thing to show you would be how are we actually hooking up a local private blockchain?

Well, on the terminal, as you can see, here we are running a local node which is adding blocks and

minting our smart contracts.

And as well, this local node is providing us if I scroll up here, 20 private accounts.

So we get a 20 market account.

So we have access to 20 accounts which are auto generated, each with 10000.

If so, we can switch through these accounts and our metamask and run transactions and really make sure

and really get a nice experience to see that, to see that our marketplace is really functional because

all these accounts can technically be considered, you know, people who would be coming up onto our

marketplace, buying and trading fees.

So hopefully this inspires you a bit, feel a little bit of extra motivation as well as provides you

with a better idea on what it is we are building specifically.

So we have these different pages, which act as kind.

Opponents, we see that we have our private blockchains set up and we see the functionality that's really

key here, getting this form to work, to mint to the blockchain.

And then the other aspect really here is iteration, right?

What are the important filtering that we need to do and consider for the user experience, right?

And that would be.

And that would be access to the main market access to our tokens, minting tokens, access to purchase

tokens, access to purchase tokens and then access to tokens that we've minted.

All right.

So are crypto.

Birds are very excited for us to get started.

Let's do this thing, IRA.

We've got a grand adventure and let's do it.

All right, so please use this video as a reference when we're going through these sections in case

you want to get a better idea.

You can always come back when we're building a page or section, and it should help you to provide a

bit more perspective on what it is we're building.

OK?

And so whenever you're ready, let's get started building out this project together.

See you in the next video.
